I started this project in July 2024 to hone my React understanding and design aesthetics.  Feel free to explore each folder with a video demo to showcase what each mini project looks like.  The first few projects have been developed with Vanilla JavaScript and React only.  I'm still learning TypeScript on Codecademy, and I'll try to incorporate my knowledge into this project as my study goes on.
